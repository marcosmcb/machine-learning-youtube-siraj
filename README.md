# Machine Learning - Siraj Raval Youtube Channel

Repository with the scripts made by Siraj while teaching Machine Learning\ Artificial Intelligence\ Blockchain \ Data Science and so on.
The code in this repository is basically a copy of the ones coded by Siraj on his videos. I have changed them as the dependencies and libraries have been upgraded along the way.

I am going to be adding more and more scripts as I watch the videos.

## Usage
You can freely use any code in this repo, just bare in mind that there is a lesson for each one of them on Siraj's channel.
